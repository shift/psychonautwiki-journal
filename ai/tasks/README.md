# Task Management Overview

## Task Organization
The refined task breakdown contains **23 atomic tasks** organized into **6 phases** with **5 specialized personas**.

### Task Structure
Each task in `tasks.json` includes:
- **Atomic scope**: Single responsibility, clear deliverables
- **Persona assignment**: Specialized role for execution
- **BDD scenarios**: Comprehensive acceptance testing
- **Dependencies**: Clear prerequisite relationships
- **Context references**: Background documentation links

### Phase Breakdown
1. **Foundation** (3 tasks, 36 hours) - NixOS environment, build system, basic Wayland
2. **Architecture** (4 tasks, 68 hours) - Project structure, DI, database migration
3. **UI Framework** (3 tasks, 60 hours) - Responsive theming, navigation, components
4. **Feature Migration** (4 tasks, 100 hours) - Substance management, experiences, statistics, settings
5. **Platform Integration** (3 tasks, 54 hours) - Input methods, file operations, system integration
6. **Testing & DevOps** (6 tasks, 140 hours) - BDD infrastructure, scenarios, CI/CD, packaging

### Persona Assignments
- **kotlin_desktop_architect**: Foundation, architecture, feature migrations
- **ui_ux_migration_specialist**: UI framework, responsive design, visualizations
- **data_migration_engineer**: Database schema and repository implementation
- **wayland_integration_specialist**: Platform integration and desktop features
- **bdd_test_engineer**: Testing infrastructure and comprehensive scenarios
- **dependency_injection_specialist**: Koin DI framework setup
- **devops_engineer**: NixOS environment and CI/CD pipeline

## Task Execution Guidelines

### Prerequisites
1. Review assigned persona definition in `ai/personas/personas.json`
2. Read relevant context file from `ai/context/`
3. Ensure all task dependencies are completed
4. Verify NixOS development environment: `nix develop`

### Quality Standards
All tasks must meet these non-negotiable standards:

#### **Code Quality**
- Follow existing Kotlin conventions and patterns
- No commented-out code or debug statements
- Proper package structure: `com.isaakhanimann.journal.<module>`
- Use version catalog for dependency management

#### **Testing Requirements**
- **Unit Tests**: 95% coverage for business logic (Kotest StringSpec)
- **Integration Tests**: 85% coverage for component interactions
- **BDD Scenarios**: 100% implementation of defined scenarios
- **UI Tests**: 75% coverage using Compose Testing

#### **Mobile-First Design**
- All UI starts with mobile constraints (320px width)
- Progressive enhancement for desktop (1200px+)
- Touch-first interactions with mouse/keyboard enhancements
- Responsive breakpoints: mobile → tablet → desktop

#### **Repository Standards**
- No binaries or build artifacts committed
- Maintain .gitignore for all generated files
- Clean commit history with meaningful messages
- No random test files or temporary scripts

### BDD Implementation Requirements

Every task includes BDD scenarios that **must** be implemented:

#### **Scenario Structure**
```gherkin
Feature: Task Feature Name
  Scenario: Descriptive scenario name
    Given initial state or preconditions
    When user action or trigger event
    Then expected outcome or verification
```

#### **Implementation Requirements**
- **Step Definitions**: Kotlin step definition classes
- **Test Data**: Builders and factories for consistent test data
- **UI Automation**: Compose Testing for UI interactions
- **Performance Validation**: Response time and resource usage checks

### Task Dependencies

**Critical Path**: FOUNDATION-001 → FOUNDATION-002 → FOUNDATION-003 → ARCHITECTURE-001 → ARCHITECTURE-002 → ARCHITECTURE-003 → ARCHITECTURE-004 → UI-001 → UI-002 → FEATURE-001 → FEATURE-002

**Parallel Tracks**:
- Testing infrastructure can run parallel to development
- Platform integration depends on foundation but can overlap with features
- DevOps tasks can be prepared while development is ongoing

### Context File References

Each task references specific context files:
- `foundation_context` - NixOS, build systems, basic infrastructure
- `architecture_migration_context` - DI, database, project structure
- `ui_framework_context` - Responsive design, theming, components
- `feature_migration_context` - Android to desktop feature porting
- `platform_integration_context` - Wayland protocols, desktop integration
- `testing_infrastructure_context` - BDD frameworks, test automation
- `devops_infrastructure_context` - CI/CD, packaging, distribution

### Progress Tracking

**Task Status Updates**:
- `pending` - Not yet started
- `in_progress` - Currently being worked on
- `completed` - All acceptance criteria met and BDD scenarios passing
- `blocked` - Cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

**Quality Gates**:
- All BDD scenarios must pass before marking complete
- Code coverage targets must be met
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Accessibility standards must be verified

## Mobile-First Desktop Adaptation

This project's unique challenge is adapting mobile-first design for desktop while maintaining:

### **Core Principles**
- **Content Prioritization**: Mobile hierarchy preserved on desktop
- **Touch-First Design**: All interactions work with touch, enhanced for mouse
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality on mobile, enhancements on desktop
- **Performance Consciousness**: Mobile-optimized performance maintained

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: 320px → 600px → 900px → 1200px+
- **Navigation Adaptation**: Bottom tabs → sidebar navigation
- **Layout Evolution**: Single column → multi-column → multi-pane
- **Interaction Enhancement**: Touch gestures → keyboard shortcuts

This systematic approach ensures the desktop port maintains the mobile app's usability while leveraging desktop capabilities.
